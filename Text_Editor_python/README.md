# Code-A-Rich-Text-Editor-With-PyQt
After last month’s workshop with Tkinter, we’ll show you another great new option for developing GUIs in Python. PyQt5 is the latest iteration of the Python binding for the cross-platform Qt GUI toolkit, implemented as a plugin.  

In this session, we’ll use PyQt5 to code our own customizable rich text editor a la Microsoft Word. We’ll implement file system interactions, selective text formatting, and other features one expects from a modern word processor.   

Prerequisites: 
— Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
— Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
